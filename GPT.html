        <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm a beginner AI user and a programmer who is passionate about leveraging
            the power of technology to solve real-world problems. From developing simple algorithms to building complex
            systems, I've always been fascinated by the endless possibilities of coding.
            Throughout my journey as a programmer, I've had the opportunity to explore a variety of programming
            languages and frameworks, and I'm constantly expanding my skillset to stay up-to-date with the latest
            industry trends. In particular, I'm excited about the potential of artificial intelligence and machine
            learning to transform the way we live and work, and I'm eager to continue learning and growing in this
            exciting field.
            On this website, you'll find examples of my work as well as my personal projects and interests. I'm always
            open to collaboration and new opportunities, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to work
            together or have any questions. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio!

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, and welcome to my about page! My name is [your name], and I'm an outdoor enthusiast and a programming
            enthusiast. I have always been passionate about rock climbing and all types of outdoor sports, and I find
            that
            these activities provide a great balance to the analytical and technical world of programming.
            I began my career as a Quality Engineer in the automotive industry, but I was always curious about
            programming.
            I started by exploring automation and microcontroller programming, and I quickly discovered that programming
            was
            something that I truly enjoyed. I found myself spending countless hours learning new languages and
            frameworks,
            and I knew that I wanted to pursue programming as a career.
            Seven years ago, I moved to Poland, and it was here that my programming journey really took off. Four years
            ago,
            I started teaching myself web development with HTML and JavaScript, and I quickly discovered that I had a
            knack
            for creating dynamic, user-friendly websites. I continued to expand my skillset, and I eventually landed a
            job
            as a Full Stack Developer.
            Today, I am grateful to be able to combine my passion for programming with my love of the outdoors. When I'm
            not
            in front of my computer, you can usually find me scaling a rock face or exploring a new hiking trail. Thank
            you
            for taking the time to learn a little bit about me, and please feel free to reach out if you have any
            questions
            or if you're interested in collaborating on a project!
